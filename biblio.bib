	abstract = {Optimization problems are present in many fields of science, engineering, and industry. In most cases, optimization problems involve a large number of complex decision variables. Often, the application of fuzzy systems to traditional control strategies requires the use of optimization techniques to define the parameters of the membership functions capturing the designer's experience. Currently, bioinspired algorithms are one of the most widely used methods for fuzzy system optimization. In this paper, we review the literature on the application of different bioinspired techniques such as Genetic Algorithms, Ant Colony Optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization, Galaxy Swarm Optimization, Harmony Search, Firefly, Differential Evolution, to optimize the parameters of the fuzzy controllers. We found particular trends in the current literature, with many methods using dynamic parameter adaptation, hybrids, distributed algorithms, and type-2 fuzzy logic.},

	abstract = {This paper presents three configurations for evolving the membership functions' parameters for a path-following fuzzy controller. Designers of fuzzy controllers have many options when selecting which parameters and how the optimization algorithm adjusts them. The experiments obtained excellent results with a relatively simple controller using three membership for each of the variables. We tested the proposed controller by a robot simulation that follows a path using a rear-wheel tracking technique. We optimized the controller's parameters using a genetic algorithm that consisted of a population of chromosomes containing the parameters of a controller. Each individual's fitness in the populations was determined by calculating the root-mean-square error resulting from each simulation. We have observed, changes in the selection of parameters that parameters to optimize, we tested four, eight, and 18, affect the results obtained and are essentialto minimize the total time of evaluations and a minimum possible error. We also tested two ranges for the random values used for initializing the population and verify that this selection also impacts the algorithms' performance.},
