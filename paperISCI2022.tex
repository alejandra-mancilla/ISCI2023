\begin{abstract}

     The optimization of fuzzy controllers is a task that requires a high
     demand for computational resources since it is necessary to carry out a
     large number of simulations to evaluate the operation of the controller.
     This is time-consuming work, and because of this, distributed and
     asynchronous bio-inspired algorithms have been proposed recently to make
     the execution achieve acceptable results in terms of scaling and
     optimization improvement. These algorithms use multiple populations and
     processors to search algorithms in parallel on each population. A problem
     with these algorithms is finding the ideal configuration that we will use
     to execute the algorithms, such as the number of populations, the number
     of processors needed, and particularly the parameters that affect the
     exploration and exploitation in the search. In this work, we compare
     homogeneous configurations for all populations against heterogeneous
     configurations in which we randomly define the parameters. We want to
     evaluate if this strategy helps us to minimize the evaluation time and
     minimize the RMSE. We will use genetic and particle swarm optimization
     algorithms in this experiment. As a case study, we applied the algorithms
     to optimize the membership functions of a fuzzy controller for the
     trajectory tracking of a mobile autonomous robot. Results show that even
     when we use random parameters in our algorithms, we continue to obtain an
     RMSE similar to the previous results. We also observe a reduction in
     execution time.

\section{Introduction}

In a recent paper, we presented a distributed algorithm for multi-population
metaheuristics \cite{mancilla2022optimal,mancilla2022tracking} using Genetic
Algorithms (GAs) \cite{back1996evolutionary,holland1992adaptation} and Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) \cite{kennedy2006swarm,clerc2010particle}. We execute
this algorithm asynchronously using a queue-based architecture
\cite{valdez2021container,merelo2018introducing}. One of the problems of using
a multi-population multi-heuristic approach is that we need to set the
algorithms' parameters for each population \cite{ma2019multi}. Finding these
parameters is time-consuming because we need to run several experiments trying
different configurations until we find a suitable parametrization. This problem
could be especially problematic if we have a multi-population algorithm
consisting of several small populations, each with a set of initial parameters
we need to set.

To tackle this problem, in the past, we followed a homogeneous
approach \cite{Mancilla2021}, simply using the same set of parameters for all
populations. In this case, we have two types of algorithms: some populations
run a GA while others execute a PSO. This situation adds another layer to the
problem because each algorithm requires different parameters. In this work, we
compare two strategies to set the initial parameters of the algorithms of the
multi-populations. The first is a homogeneous approach with fixed values, and
the second is a heterogeneous strategy selecting random values from a
predefined range of values established for some of the parameters of the
algorithms \cite{gong2011distributed,hernandez2017randomized}. 

We organized this paper as follows. First, in Section \ref{sec:experiments}, we
describe our proposal and define the experimental setup consisting on
optimizing a fuzzy rear-wheel controller using different configurations on a
benchmark problem. We show and discuss the results in Section
\ref{sec:results}. Finally, we present our conclusions and future work in
Section \ref{sec:conclusions}.

\section{Methodology and Experimental Setup}\label{sec:experiments}

We continue with our previous work, in which we optimized the parameters for a
fuzzy controller used for path tracking by an autonomous mobile robot. This
problem is particularly time-consuming because we could follow these three
steps to optimize this type of controller: First, we run one or more
simulations with the controller; this is time-consuming, then we measure the
controller's error in each simulation, calculate an average, and if we are not
satisfied with the results, we adjust the parameters and start again. That is
why designers of fuzzy controllers often use population-based metaheuristics to
adjust these parameters. However, even when using a metaheuristic, fuzzy
controller optimization continues to be time-consuming. We briefly explain the
multi-population multi-heuristic algorithm used in this paper. The authors more
extensively explain the algorithm in \cite{mancilla2022optimal}.

We propose an event-based, distributed algorithm that exchanges data between
processes using message queues for asynchronous communication (see Fig.
\ref{fig:Diagrams}). (1) We start the algorithm by executing a single task that
pushes a specified $n$ number of populations to the Population Queue. Each
population message contains the initial configuration and the type of
metaheuristic used by that particular population. The main idea is that each
process runs a metaheuristic for a small number of iterations on a population
received as a message and then pushes the resulting (evolved) population to the
Evolved Population Queue (4). (3) Workers take messages asynchronously to
process the data (populations). Each worker inside a container continuously
checks for messages in the Population Queue and, after receiving a population,
executes a metaheuristic on this population for several iterations. (4)
resulting populations from the Evolved Population Queue. (5-6) An essential
component of the architecture is the Combinator process, responsible for taking
the resulting populations from the Evolved Population Queue and, after reading
the message, stopping the algorithm if the number of function evaluations has
been reached or if a suitable solution was found.

However, the primary responsibility of this component is to migrate or combine
populations arriving from the Evolved Population Queue. The combination method
we propose in this work is as follows. We take the top two best solutions from
each population and insert them in a buffer that always keeps the top-k
solutions. Finally, we replace the two worst solutions for the population with
the buffer's current first and second-best solutions.

\label{fig:s_strategies}
\end{figure}

One of the problems of metaheuristics is establishing the initial values of the
algorithm's parameters. Usually, bio-inspired metaheuristics have parameters
that control how much the algorithm does an exploration or exploitation over
the search space \cite{yang2013swarm}. If the algorithm exploits too much, there is a higher risk of
premature convergence to a local minimum. On the other hand, if there is too
much exploration, the algorithm will search allmost randomly, constantly
changing the area of attention. A balance between the two types of search is
required to escape local minima while simultaneously doing a local search in a
promising area.

When we have several populations, we could use a strategy to
have some populations tending to exploration and others to exploitation. The
idea is that this strategy keeps a natural balance between the two extremes.
The problem remains: how do we set the parameters now that we have many more, a
set for each population? A simple heterogeneous strategy proposed by \cite{gong2011distributed} 
randomly sets each population's parameters. Although simple, the random
strategy has yielded promising results in other multi-population algorithms .
The other strategy found in the literature is using a single, well-balanced
configuration for each metaheuristic algorithm and repeating the same
configuration in all populations. In Fig. \ref{fig:s_strategies} on the top
image, we can see a representation of the homogenous strategy (Fig.
\ref{fig:s_homogeneo}) and the heterogeneous strategy at the bottom (Fig.
\ref{fig:s_heterogeneo}).

\subsection{Control Problem}\label{sub:fuzzy}

The benchmark control problem we use to validate our proposal is the rear-wheel
controller described by Paden \cite{paden_survey_2016}. In this control problem, we have as
input the error $e$ that is the distance between the rear wheel and the desired
trajectory. The error is positive if the wheel is to the left of the path and
negative if it is to the right. The second input is the angle between the
tangent at the nearest point in the trajectory and the bearing
vector $\theta_{e}$. The output is the angular velocity $\omega$. We take the
design of the controller from a previous work \cite{mancilla2022tracking} using five membership
functions for each input variable. We have two signs because the error and the
heading can be left or right. We are tuning the ten parameters defining each
MF. The fixed and variable parameters of the MFs are in Table \ref{tab:mfs}. We proposed a
controller with a total of twenty five fuzzy rules.

\begin{table}[htbp] \caption{ Parameters for the controller's MFs}
    \label{tab:mfs} \centering
    \begin{tabular}{cccc}
    \hline
     \textbf{Variable} & \textbf{Linguistic Value} & \textbf{MF}& \textbf{Parameters}  \\
    \hline
    $\theta_e$ & high negative  & $\mu_{trap}$  & $[-50, -5, -b, -b+c]$     \\ 
    $\theta_e$ & medium negative& $\mu_{tria}$  & $[-d-e, -d, -d+e]$     \\ 
    $\theta_e$ & low            & $\mu_{tria}$  & $[-a, 0, a]$     \\ 
    $\theta_e$ & medium positive& $\mu_{tria}$  & $[d-e, d, d+e]$     \\ 
    $\theta_e$ & high positive  & $\mu_{trap}$  & $[b-c, b, 5, 50]$ \\

    $error$ & low            & $\mu_{tria}$  & $[-f, 0, f]$     \\ 
    $error$ & medium positive& $\mu_{tria}$  & $[i-j, i, i+j]$     \\ 
    $error$ & high positive  & $\mu_{trap}$  & $[g-h, g, 5, 50]$ \\

    \hline
    $\omega$ & high negative  & $\mu_{trap}$  & $[-50, -5, -1, -0.5]$     \\ 
    $\omega$ & medium negative& $\mu_{tria}$  & $[-1, -0.5, 0]$     \\ 
    $\omega$ & low            & $\mu_{tria}$  & $[-0.5, 0, 0.5]$     \\ 
    $\omega$ & medium positive& $\mu_{tria}$  & $[0, 0.5,1]$     \\ 
    $\omega$ & high positive  & $\mu_{trap}$  & $[0.5, 1 ,5, 50]$     \\ 
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The fitness of each candidate solution, in this case, the fuzzy controller
generated with the parameterized MFs, is established by running three
simulations in these three paths (see Fig. \ref{fig:Routes}).

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[angle=0,width=1\textwidth]{Routes}
  \caption{Paths used for fitness evaluation.}
  \label{fig:Routes} 
\end{figure}

\subsection{Setup}\label{sub:conf}

The distributed algorithms' parameters are shown in Table \ref{tab:alg_params}.
We configured the multi-population algorithm with seven populations of size
nine, this population size may seem small, but we need to remember that this is
a multi-population algorithm, so the total population size is estimated by
multiplying the population size by the number of sub-populations, in this case
the total size is 63. Each worker process will execute four iterations
(generations) of the algorithm, again the number of generations is small, but
this is by design. The small number of generations is required to distribute
the work among all worker processes. All populations will complete four cycles;
this means they will pass through the combinator module four times. We also
show the values we use to initialize the homogenous and heterogeneous
parameters.

Using interval notation, we defined a range from each parameter. We
can see that the interval includes the value specified for the homogenous
strategy in each parameter. For mutation probability in GAs, we set the value
at 0.3, and the range for random values is between 0.1 and 0.5. We experimented
with widening the range but did not receive better results. We repeated the
same setup for the other parameters. We wanted to maintain the speed limit sign
for PSO, so we established a range of $[-0.20, -0.30]$ and $[0.20, 0.30]$,
respectively.

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

In Table \ref{tab:rmse}, we show the results of the experiments. Results with
parameters with random values are compared with the distributed
versions with fixed parameters found in our previous work.

We note that the distributed PSO with random parameters implementation
yields better results than the distributed homogeneous parameters on average.
Here we show the average error obtained in 30 runs. Here we show the best RMSE
obtained by the best fuzzy controller found in each run.

      \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In Table \ref{tab:time} we show the time needed to complete each run in
seconds. When comparing the time required to complete each execution of the
algorithms, there is no substantial difference between versions. As expected,
the distributed version with random parameters turned out similar to that with
fixed parameters. An interesting case is the GA that took less time to complete
in the heterogeneous strategy. This shortening in time could be related to the
time it takes for a simulation to complete. Because we terminate the simulation
early if the robot loses track of the trajectory, the time required to complete
the simulations for a population of incapable individuals could take less time.
This result, however, does not happen in the PSO case, where the times are
similar.

We did the statistical Ztest, comparing the same algorithms but with
homogeneous parameters that are those of the column that we see on the left
side and the algorithms with heterogeneous parameters that we see in the upper
row. We concluded that there is not enough evidence to reject the null
hypothesis. The p-value results show that it is not within the acceptable
confidence interval. We show in Table \ref{tab:ztest}.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusions}

In conclusion we presented a design and implementation of a distributed 
multi-population, multi-algorithm method to optimize the parameters of 
the MFs for a fuzzy controller.

We run experiments with both heterogeneous and homogeneous configurations
of the algorithms.

Preliminary results show that a distributed execution with homogeneous 
parameters gives similar results to a distributed implementation with 
random parameters in a similar time.  By using random heterogeneous 
parameters, we do not spend the time needed to find a suitable set of
parameters, we only need to specify a range.

For future work, we need to run the experiments in a computer with 
more cores or on the cloud. As a next step,  we could implement 
other optimization algorithms. Also, there are other parameters that 
are important like the poplulation size and the number of iterations.
Moreover, we can also investigate if a dynamic tuning of parameters yields 
better results. For instance, the Combinator process could adjust the parameters 
in each iterations taking into account certain metrics of the population like 
the diversity or the average fitness.
